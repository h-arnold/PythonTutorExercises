# Setup Guide

This guide covers setting up the PythonTutorExercises repository for development or use in a classroom.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bassaleg-School/PythonTutorExercises.git
cd PythonTutorExercises
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

**On Linux/macOS**:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows**:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs:
- `pytest` (testing framework)
- `ruff` (linter)
- `ipykernel` (Jupyter kernel)
- `jupyterlab` (notebook interface)

## Verification

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest -q
```

All tests should pass (or fail for incomplete student exercises, which is expected).

### Run Tests Against Solutions

```bash
scripts/verify_solutions.sh -q
```

or:

```bash
PYTUTOR_NOTEBOOKS_DIR=notebooks/solutions pytest -q
```

All solution tests should pass.

### Start Jupyter Lab

```bash
jupyter lab
```

This opens the Jupyter interface in your browser where you can work on notebooks.

## For Students

If you're a student working on exercises:

1. **Clone the repository** (or accept the GitHub Classroom assignment)
2. **Install dependencies** as described above
3. **Open a notebook** in Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab notebooks/ex001_sanity.ipynb
   ```
4. **Complete the exercise** in the cell tagged `exercise1` (or `exercise2`, etc.)
5. **Run tests** to check your work:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_ex001_sanity.py -v
   ```
6. **Repeat** until all tests pass

## For Teachers

If you're creating or modifying exercises:

1. **Complete the setup** as described above
2. **Review the documentation**:
   - [Project Structure](project-structure.md)
   - [Testing Framework](testing-framework.md)
   - [Exercise Generation](exercise-generation.md)
3. **Create exercises** using the scaffolding script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/new_exercise.py ex042 "Your Title" --slug your_slug
   ```
4. **Author the exercise** following the guidelines in [Exercise Generation](exercise-generation.md)
5. **Verify solutions** pass tests:
   ```bash
   scripts/verify_solutions.sh tests/test_ex042_your_slug.py
   ```

## Linting and Code Quality

### Run Ruff Linter

```bash
ruff check .
```

### Auto-Fix Issues

```bash
ruff check --fix .
```

Configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.

## GitHub Classroom Integration

This repository is designed to work with GitHub Classroom:

1. **Create an assignment** from this template repository
2. **Students accept** the assignment and get their own copy
3. **Students complete exercises** and push commits
4. **Autograding runs** via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`)
5. **Tests verify** student solutions automatically

### Autograding Configuration

The `.github/workflows/tests.yml` workflow:
- Triggers on every push and pull request
- Sets up Python 3.11
- Installs dependencies
- Runs `pytest`

Students see test results in the GitHub Actions tab of their repository.

## Development Workflow

Recommended workflow for creating and testing exercises:

```bash
# 1. Create a new branch
git checkout -b add-ex042-variables

# 2. Generate the exercise
python scripts/new_exercise.py ex042 "Variables and Types" --slug variables_and_types

# 3. Organise the folder
mv exercises/ex042_variables_and_types exercises/sequence/modify/

# 4. Author the notebook
jupyter lab notebooks/ex042_variables_and_types.ipynb

# 5. Write tests
$EDITOR tests/test_ex042_variables_and_types.py

# 6. Complete the solution
jupyter lab notebooks/solutions/ex042_variables_and_types.ipynb

# 7. Verify tests pass on solution
scripts/verify_solutions.sh tests/test_ex042_variables_and_types.py -v

# 8. Verify tests fail on student notebook
pytest tests/test_ex042_variables_and_types.py -v

# 9. Commit and push
git add exercises/ notebooks/ tests/
git commit -m "Add ex042: Variables and Types"
git push origin add-ex042-variables

# 10. Create a pull request
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail with "No module named 'tests'"

Ensure you're running pytest from the repository root and that you've installed the package in editable mode:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Notebook Not Found Error

Check that:
- The notebook exists at the expected path
- The path in the test file matches the actual notebook location
- If using `PYTUTOR_NOTEBOOKS_DIR`, the solution notebook exists

### Cell Tag Not Found

Verify the cell metadata in Jupyter:
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab
2. Select the code cell
3. Click the gear icon (property inspector) in the right sidebar
4. Check that the tag (e.g., `exercise1`) is listed under "Cell Tags"

### Import Errors in Student Code

Students sometimes forget imports. Remind them that:
- Each tagged cell is executed in isolation
- All necessary imports must be in the tagged cell
- They cannot rely on imports from other cells

## Environment Variables

### `PYTUTOR_NOTEBOOKS_DIR`

Redirects notebook lookups to a different directory.

**Usage**:
```bash
export PYTUTOR_NOTEBOOKS_DIR=notebooks/solutions
pytest
```

**Purpose**: Run the same tests against solution notebooks to verify they're correct.

## CI/CD Workflows

### `tests.yml`

Runs on every push and pull request:
- Installs dependencies
- Runs pytest against student notebooks
- Reports pass/fail status

### `tests-solutions.yml`

Manual workflow (workflow_dispatch) to verify solution notebooks:
- Sets `PYTUTOR_NOTEBOOKS_DIR=notebooks/solutions`
- Runs pytest against solution notebooks
- Useful for verifying solutions are correct before releasing exercises

Trigger manually in the GitHub Actions tab.
