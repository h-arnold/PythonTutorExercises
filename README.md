# Python Tutor Exercises (prototype)

A teaching platform for secondary-school programming that keeps everything in the browser: students complete exercises inside notebooks, run code inline, and get autograding feedback. Teachers can generate new exercises quickly and bundle selected exercises into GitHub Classroom template repos.

This is a working prototype. The core workflow exists, but several pieces are incomplete (see Status below).

## What this project does

A teacher‑first toolchain that turns lesson plans into ready‑to‑run Python exercises—designed for secondary classrooms and low‑friction delivery.

For teachers:
- Generate complete, pedagogy‑aligned exercises in seconds (student notebook, solution mirror, and tests).
- Ship browser‑ready assignments your students can run inline (Codespaces now; Pyodide client‑side execution planned).
- Autograde student work with pytest so learners get immediate, actionable feedback.
- Create GitHub Classroom template repos with a CLI and consistent VS Code/devcontainer configs.

For students:
- Work inside a single, inline notebook cell with task, code, and debugger together.
- Get fast feedback from tests and clear, scaffolded prompts.
- No local installs required (when using Codespaces or the planned Pyodide runtime).

Why teachers will care:
- Slash setup time and eliminate “it works on my machine” problems ✅
- Spend classroom time teaching, not troubleshooting environments ✅
- Designed to be age‑appropriate and easy to adopt ✅

## How it works (plain‑English overview)

<figure style="display:inline-block;">

  <figcaption>Figure: Example student activity — a tagged cell with inline feedback.</figcaption>
</figure>

1. Each exercise is a notebook in [notebooks/](notebooks/), with a tagged cell like exercise1.
2. Tests in [tests/](tests/) extract that tagged cell and run it automatically.
3. Solution notebooks live in [notebooks/solutions/](notebooks/solutions/) and are used to verify the tests.
4. A CLI can bundle selected exercises into a GitHub Classroom template repo.

## Status

What works (mostly):
- Exercise scaffolding and tests via the generation workflow
- Tagged‑cell autograding ([tests/notebook_grader.py](tests/notebook_grader.py))
- Template repo creation with notebooks, tests, and VS Code settings
- GitHub Classroom workflow (template repo + autograding)

Known gaps / not fully working yet:
- The template repo currently includes solution notebooks (not suitable for students)
- Parts of the template‑repo population flow are untested
- Full VS Code for Web support needs a Pyodide‑based Python kernel integration

Where help is needed:
- Excluding solutions from student template repos
- Hardening the template‑repo CLI and improving test coverage
- VS Code for Web: building a Pyodide‑backed kernel that works with the official Jupyter extension

## Quickstart (exercise generation via Copilot Chat)

This repo includes a custom Copilot Chat mode for generating exercises.

1. Open this repository in VS Code.
2. Open Copilot Chat and pick the Exercise Generation mode (defined in [.github/agents/exercise_generation.md.agent.md](.github/agents/exercise_generation.md.agent.md)).
3. Describe the exercise (topic, difficulty, examples, and number of parts).
   <figure style="display:inline-block;">

     <figcaption>Figure: Copilot Chat prompt used to generate a new exercise.</figcaption>
   </figure>
4. Review the generated notebook, tests, and metadata for accuracy.
5. Verify the solution notebook passes tests:
   - [scripts/verify_solutions.sh](scripts/verify_solutions.sh) -q

## Quickstart (create a GitHub Classroom template repo)

The template‑repo CLI packages selected exercises into a ready‑to‑use GitHub Classroom template.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   - Linux / macOS:
     - `python -m venv .venv`
     - `source .venv/bin/activate`
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     - `python -m venv .venv`
     - `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
2. Install dependencies:
   - `python -m pip install -U pip`
   - `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"`
3. Authenticate GitHub CLI:
   - `gh auth login`
4. Create a template repo (example: all sequence exercises):
   - `template_repo_cli create --construct sequence --repo-name sequence-exercises`
5. In GitHub Classroom, create a new assignment and select the template repo.`
