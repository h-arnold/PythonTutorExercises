# Solutions for Sequence Modify Variables (ex003)

1. Assign `greeting = "Hi there!"` so the print statement directly echoes the new value.
2. Change `subject` to "coding" and leave the rest of the string the same so the output becomes `I enjoy coding lessons.`
3. Set `food = "sushi"` before the print so the sentence reads `My favourite food is sushi`.
4. Update the prompt to `Type the name of your favourite fruit:` and the final print to `print("I like " + fruit)`; when the hidden input returns `mango`, it prints `I like mango`.
5. Change the prompt to `Which town do you like the most?` and the final print to `print("I would visit " + place)` so the message becomes `I would visit Cardiff` when the test feeds `Cardiff`.
6. Use the prompt `Please enter your name:` and print `Welcome, " + name + "!"` so the output is `Welcome, Alex!` when the input supplies `Alex`.
7. Reassign `first_word = "Variables"` and `second_word = "matter"` to produce `Variables matter`.
8. Keep `part1 = "Keep"` and change `part2 = "experimenting"` so the final output is `Keep experimenting`.
9. Set `greeting = "Good"`, `time_of_day = "evening"`, and `audience = "everyone!"` so `print(greeting + " " + time_of_day + " " + audience)` prints `Good evening everyone!`.
10. Assign `part_one = "Variables"`, `part_two = "and strings"`, and `part_three = "make a message!"` so the concatenated result reads `Variables and strings make a message!`.
