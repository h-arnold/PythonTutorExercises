# Sequence Modification Basics

**ID:** ex002
**Construct:** sequence
**Type:** modify
**Difficulty:** very easy

## Student prompt
- Open the matching notebook in `notebooks/ex002_sequence_modify_basics.ipynb`.
- Each exercise shows you working code. Your task is to **modify** it to meet the new requirements.
- Write your solution in the notebook cells tagged `exercise1` through `exercise10`.
- Run `pytest -q tests/test_ex002_sequence_modify_basics.py` until all tests pass.

## Teacher notes
- Created: 2026-01-09
- Target concepts: 
  - Basic `print()` statements
  - String output
  - Simple arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
  - String concatenation with `+`
  - **No variables** at this stage — only literals
- Exercise type: **Modification** (students modify working code)
- Difficulty progression:
  - Exercises 1-5: Single simple changes (one word, one operation)
  - Exercises 6-10: Multiple elements or slightly more complex modifications
- Total exercises: 10
- Expected completion time: 30-45 minutes for beginners

## Key pedagogical notes
This is designed as the **very first** set of exercises for students who have never programmed before. The activities focus on:
1. Understanding that code can be changed and the output will change
2. Basic syntax of `print()` statements
3. Distinguishing between text (strings) and numbers
4. Understanding that operators (+, -, *, /) work on numbers
5. Learning that strings can be joined with `+`

All exercises are self-contained and require only modification of existing working code, making them less intimidating than writing from scratch.
