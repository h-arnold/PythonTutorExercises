# Sequence Debug Logic

**ID**: ex005  
**Construct**: sequence  
**Type**: debug  
**Difficulty**: easy

## Learning objective
Students will practise diagnosing and fixing common *logical* errors involving string values, variable assignments, and short message construction. These tasks reinforce careful reading of expected output and simple string concatenation.

## Student prompt
- Open the matching notebook in `notebooks/`.
- Edit the buggy code in the cell tagged `exercise1` (or `exercise2`, …) and make it produce the shown expected output.
- After fixing the code, write a brief explanation in the corresponding `explanationN` cell describing what was wrong.
- Run `pytest -q` to verify your solutions.
