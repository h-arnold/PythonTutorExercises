# Order of teaching

These exercises are intended to be taught in the following order:

1. [**Sequence Modification Basics**](`ex002_sequence_modify_basics`)

[Supporting docs](./modify/ex002_sequence_modify_basics/)
[Notebook](notebooks/ex002_sequence_modify_basics.ipynb)

   - Focus: Basic `print()` statements, string output, simple arithmetic, and string concatenation.
   - Type: Modification exercises where students change existing code.
   - Purpose: Introduce students to coding by modifying working examples, helping them understand syntax and basic operations without the complexity of writing from scratch.

2. [**Sequence Modify Variables**](`ex003_sequence_modify_variables`)

[Supporting docs](./modify/ex003_sequence_modify_variables/)
[Notebook](notebooks/ex003_sequence_modify_variables.ipynb)

   - Focus: Assigning strings to variables, reading text with `input()`, and joining variables via concatenation.
   - Type: Modification exercises where students tweak assignments and print statements.
   - Purpose: Reinforce how variables hold values, show how `input()` stores text, and practise building final strings by combining variables.
